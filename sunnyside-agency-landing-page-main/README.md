### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### My Process

I used these tools to complete the challenge.

- HTML
- CSS & Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-First Approach

### Problem Faced

- In this challenge, I ran across the css url() problem with vite. I also tried using other ways to keep the background image but ended up having to work around using the <img> tag for background. If you have any other solution to the problem I'd love to hear it.
